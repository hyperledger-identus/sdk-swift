/// `JWTCredential` provides a convenient way to parse the payload of a JWTâ€‘based
/// Verifiable Credential using a JOSE envelope (JWS/JWT). It extracts the JWT
/// payload and decodes it into a strongly typed VC model. This is useful when
/// working with ecosystems that transport VCs in JWT form, as described in the
/// W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM 1.0/1.1/2.0) and related specs.
///
/// Notes
/// - This utility focuses on parsing/decoding. It does not perform cryptographic
///   verification of the JWT/JWS. You should verify signatures and validate keys
///   (e.g., via DID resolution or trusted key material) before trusting contents.
/// - While this helper targets JOSE (JWS/JWT) envelopes, similar patterns apply
///   to COSE/CBOR envelopes if you introduce a corresponding decoder.
///
/// - Conforms to:
///   - `Credential`
///   - `ProvableCredential`
///   - `StorableCredential`
