# ``Mercury``

Mercury is a powerful and flexible library for working with decentralized identifiers and secure communications protocols. Whether you are a developer looking to build a secure and private messaging app, or you are building a more complex decentralized system that requires trusted peer-to-peer connections, Mercury provides the tools and features you need to establish, manage, and secure your communications with ease.

## A Secure Communications Protocol SDK for DIDs

Mercury is a comprehensive library that provides a set of secure, standards-based communications protocols for establishing and managing trusted, peer-to-peer connections and interactions between decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Mercury is designed to be transport-agnostic and interoperable, meaning that it can be used across a wide range of communication channels and platforms.

DIDCommV2 is a secure, privacy-preserving messaging protocol that allows for the exchange of information between DIDs in a secure and efficient manner. Mercury supports a range of DIDCommV2 operations, including pack encrypted and unpack, which enables users to securely transmit and receive messages across the network.

With Mercury, developers can easily establish and manage trusted, peer-to-peer connections between DIDs, allowing for secure and private communication across a range of platforms and use cases. Whether you are building a messaging app, a decentralized social network, or any other application that requires secure and private communications, Mercury provides the tools and features you need to get the job done.

Mercury also provides a range of advanced features, including support for message threading, priority levels, and message expiration, as well as support for a range of transport protocols, including HTTP.
