# ``Castor``

Castor is a powerful and flexible library for working with DIDs. Whether you are building a decentralized application or a more traditional system that requires secure and private identity management, Castor provides the tools and features you need to create, manage, and resolve DIDs with ease.

## A Decentralized Identifier (DID) Library

Castor is a powerful and versatile library that provides a suite of decentralised identifier (DID) operations. It enables developers to create, manage, and resolve standards-based DID in a user-controlled manner. Castor is designed to be flexible and easy to integrate into a variety of decentralized applications and systems.

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that allows individuals and organizations to create and manage their own digital identity. DIDs provide a secure, decentralized, and privacy-preserving way to authenticate and verify identity, without relying on centralized authorities or intermediaries. Castor allows developers to leverage the power of DIDs by providing a simple and efficient way to create, manage, and resolve them.

Castor supports the creation and resolution of two types of DIDs out of the box: prism and peer.

With Castor, developers can create and manage DIDs, generate and manage their associated public and private keys, and resolve DIDs to retrieve associated data. Castor also provides a range of advanced features, such as support for multiple key types and encryption methods, and a flexible API for customizing and extending its functionality.
